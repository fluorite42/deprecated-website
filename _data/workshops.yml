        abstract: |
            The computational complexity of quantum programs is influenced by the limitations of the native gate set and the constraints imposed by qubit topology. 
            These factors necessitate advanced compilation techniques for efficient execution. 
            Our experimental data reveal that approximately 23.1% of gates in quantum programs are *dead gates*, which do not contribute to any meaningful alteration in the quantum state. 
            Removing these dead gates would provide the potential opportunity to reduce the size and improve the accuracy of the quantum program. 
            However, we observe that existing methods, including those integrated into Qiskit Transpiler, cannot adequately remove these unnecessary gates. 
            In this work, we introduce Dementor (<u>De</u>ad Quantu<u>m</u> Gat<u>e</u> Elimi<u>n</u>a<u>tor</u>), which efficiently detects and removes dead gates by considering a range of redundancy patterns. 
            To evaluate the efficacy of Dementor, we conducted experiments on IBM quantum processors, which have two distinct native gate sets: Echoed Cross-Resonance (ECR)-based and Controlled-X (CX)-based. 
            Our experiments show that Dementor achieves a reduction in the number of decomposed gates by an average of 46.4% on ECR-based systems and by an average of 60.6% on CX-based systems compared to Qiskit Transpiler with optimization level 3.
