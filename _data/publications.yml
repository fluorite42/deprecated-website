            A zoned neutral atom architecture achieves exceptional fidelity by segregating the execution spaces of 1- and 2-qubit gates, being a promising candidate for high-accuracy quantum systems. 
            Unfortunately, naïvely applying programs designed for static qubit topologies to zoned architectures may result in most execution time being consumed by intra-zone travels of atoms. 
            To address this, we introduce *Mantra* (Minimizing trAp movemeNts for aTom aRray Architectures), which rewrites quantum programs to reduce the interleaving of single- and two-qubit gates. 
            *Mantra* incorporates three strategies: (i) a fountain-shaped controlled-Z (CZ) chain, (ii) ZZ-interaction protocol without a 1-qubit gate, and (iii) preemptive gate scheduling. 
            *Mantra* reduces inter-zone movements by 68%, physical gate counts by 35%, and improves circuit fidelities by 17% compared to the standard executions.

        abstract: | 
            The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is introduced to efficiently solve combinatorial optimization problems. 
            Despite the promise of QAOA, the cost of executing QAOA circuits at scale for quantum advantage may still be excessive for the near-future quantum device. 
            We observe the increasing overhead of QAOA circuit execution in the native gate translation. 
            To execute QAOA circuits on a real quantum computing device, Hamiltonians composed of predefined specific rotations (e.g., ZZ and X) should be decomposed into finite native gates. 
            By adopting rotational combinations that utilize native gates more directly than the standard QAOA circuit model, the execution cost on real quantum devices can be reduced. 
            In this study, we propose *Racoon* (<u>R</u>ot<u>a</u>tional Spa<u>c</u>e Virtualizati<u>o</u>n for QA<u>O</u>A A<u>n</u>satz), an algorithm-hardware co-design approach that revisits the synthesis conditions of QAOA circuits and selects alternative candidates with different rotational combinations. 
            Our analysis of six commercial quantum processors demonstrates that applying *Racoon* to QAOA circuits for the 4-node Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model reduces the number of native gates by an average of 23% and up to 79%. 
            Consequently, using *Racoon* results in 43% fewer training epochs, 41% lower training energy consumption, and a 6% improvement in inference on average compared to standard QAOA. 
            *Racoon* consistently reduces circuit depth as the number of qubits and layers increases, achieving 123 × more circuit depth reduction compared to the recently proposed Depth First Search (DFS)-based method. 
            Furthermore, we confirm that *Racoon*'s method can be extended to State-of-The-Art QAOAs with modified ansätze and to the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE).

            Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have attracted remarkable interest over the past few years because of their potential computational advantages on near-term quantum devices. 
            They leverage a hybrid approach that integrates classical and quantum computing resources to solve high dimensional problems that are challenging for classical approaches alone. 
            In the training process ofvariational circuits, constructing an accurate probability distribution for each epoch is not always necessary, creating opportunities to reduce computational costs through shot reduction. 
            However, existing shot-allocation methods that capitalize on this potential often lack adaptive feedback or aretied to specific classical optimizers, which limits their applicability to common VQAs and broader optimization techniques. 
            Our observations indicate that the information entropy of a quantum circuit's output distribution exhibits an approximately exponential relationship with the numberof shots needed to achieve a target Hellinger distance. 
            In this work, we propose a distribution-adaptive dynamic shot (DDS) framework that efficiently adjusts the number of shots per iterationin VQAs using the entropy distribution from the prior training epoch. 
            Our results demonstrate that the DDS framework sustains inference accuracy while achieving a ~50% reduction in average shotcount compared to fixed-shot training, and ~60% higher accuracy than recently proposed tiered shot allocation methods. 
            Furthermore, in noisy simulations that reflect the error rates of actual IBM quantum systems, DDS achieves approximately a ~30% reduction in the total number of shots compared to the fixed-shot method with minimal degradation in accuracy, and offers about ~70% higher computational accuracy than tiered shot allocation methods.
