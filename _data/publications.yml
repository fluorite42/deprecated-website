            A zoned neutral atom architecture achieves high fidelity by segregating the execution spaces of single-qubit and two-qubit gates, making it a promising candidate for high-accuracy quantum systems. 
            However, naïvely applying quantum program structures designed for static qubit topologies to zoned architectures may result in most execution time being consumed by inter- and intra-zone atom movements.

            To address this challenge, we introduce *Mantra* (Minimizing trAp movemeNts for aTom aRray Architectures), which rewrites quantum programs to reduce the interleaving of single-qubit and two-qubit gates, thereby minimizing atom movement overhead. 
            *Mantra* incorporates three key strategies: (i) a fountain-shaped controlled-Z (CZ) chain, (ii) a single-qubit gate-less ZZ-rotation protocol, and (iii) preemptive alignment of identical zoned gates.
            Our evaluations demonstrate that *Mantra* reduces inter-zone movements by 68%, decreases physical gate counts by 35%, and improves circuit fidelities by 17% compared to standard execution in scenarios where gate execution is isolated by zones. 
            Even when single-qubit gate execution is allowed within entangling zones, *Mantra* reduces trap transfer overhead between acousto-optic deflectors (AOD) and spatial light modulators (SLM) by 64% and shuttling time by 43%, achieving an overall run-time reduction of 57% compared to standard programs.

            The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is introduced to efficiently solve combinatorial optimization problems. Despite the promise of QAOA, the cost of executing QAOA circuits at scale for quantum advantage may still be excessive for the near-future quantum device. We observe the increasing overhead of QAOA circuit execution in the native gate translation. To execute QAOA circuits on a real quantum computing device, Hamiltonians composed of predefined specific rotations (e.g., ZZ and X) should be decomposed into finite native gates. By adopting rotational combinations that utilize native gates more directly than the standard QAOA circuit model, the execution cost on real quantum devices can be reduced. In this study, we propose Racoon (Rotational Space Virtualization for QAOA Ansatz), an algorithm-hardware co-design approach that revisits the synthesis conditions of QAOA circuits and selects alternative candidates with different rotational combinations. Our analysis of six commercial quantum processors demonstrates that applying Racoon to QAOA circuits for the 4-node Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model reduces the number of native gates by an average of 23% and up to 79%. Consequently, using Racoon results in 43% fewer training epochs, 41% lower training energy consumption, and a 6% improvement in inference on average compared to standard QAOA. Racoon consistently reduces circuit depth as the number of qubits and layers increases, achieving 123 × more circuit depth reduction compared to the recently proposed Depth First Search (DFS)-based method. Furthermore, we confirm that Racoon's method can be extended to State-of-The-Art QAOAs with modified ansätze and to the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Our results suggest that Racoon can be a promising solution for reducing the execution cost of QAOA circuits on near-term quantum devices.
